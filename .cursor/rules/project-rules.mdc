## Project Overview

This is a personal blog website built with Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages. It uses the "So Simple" theme by Michael Rose (https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) and is deployed at https://oliverbarreto.com.

The site features blog posts primarily in the `_posts/blog/` directory, with content about technology, productivity, and development topics.

## Blog - Website Structure

The blog website has the following structure defined in the `_data/navigation.yml` file:

```yaml
- title: Home
  url: / # This is the home page - index.md file
- title: Blog
  url: /posts/ # This is the home page - posts.md file. Blog posts are handled by the theme,  we just need to create a file for each post in the _posts/blog/ directory
- title: Projects # This is a page about relevant projects that I have done, or currently working on.
  url: /projects/ # This is the projects page - projects.md file
- title: CallsOnYourMac # This is a Product Page of one of my personal projects: "Calls On Your Mac", a macOS app that allows you to make phone/video calls from your Mac using Continuity and the iPhone. It also allows users to manage Google Meet/Webex/Zoom.
  url: /callsonyourmac/ # This is the calls on your mac page - callsonyourmac.md file
- title: Search
  url: /search/ # This is the search page - search.md file. This is a simple search page that allows you to search the blog posts.
```

## Development Commands

### Local Development Setup

**Important**: Before running locally, you must modify `_config.yml` to enable the local theme:

1. Uncomment this line: `theme: jekyll-theme-so-simple`
2. Keep this line: `remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"`

**Warning**: Before pushing to GitHub, you must comment out the local theme line again to prevent GitHub Actions failures.

### Running the Site Locally

```bash
# Build and run with Docker (recommended)
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:4000. The Docker container has hot reloading enabled, so changes to local files will be reflected automatically.

### Stopping Local Development

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Project Architecture

### Directory Structure

- `_posts/blog/` - All blog posts in Markdown format with YAML front matter
- `_data/` - Site configuration data (navigation, authors, text)
- `_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration and site settings
- `images/` - Static assets including blog post images in `images/blogposts/`
- `downloads/` - Downloadable files and assets

### Theme Configuration

The site uses a remote theme setup that switches between local and production modes:

- **Local development**: Uses `theme: jekyll-theme-so-simple`
- **Production (GitHub Pages)**: Uses `remote_theme: "mmistakes/so-simple-theme@3.2.0"`

### Content Management

Blog posts follow Jekyll conventions:

- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` in `_posts/blog/`
- YAML front matter with layout, title, and other metadata
- Images stored in `images/blogposts/` with descriptive filenames
- Posts are automatically organized by date and categories

### Deployment

The site auto-deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. Ensure the `_config.yml` is set to production mode (local theme commented out) before pushing.

## Important Notes

- Always verify theme configuration before pushing to prevent build failures
- Images should be optimized and placed in appropriate subdirectories
- The site uses Google Analytics (UA-46702055-1) and Disqus comments
- Navigation is configured in `_data/navigation.yml`
