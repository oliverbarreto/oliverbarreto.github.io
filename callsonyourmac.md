Welcome to Calls on your Mac !!! This is a free app that encourages Apple to bring a nice and modern UI to launch calls from your iPhone on the Mac. If you are the lucky owner of a Mac, chances are that you also have an iPhone. But, do you have an iPhone in your Mac ??? Not out of the box, even though we deserve a better experience.

## Make phone calls on your Mac, with Apple's out of the box (lack of) UX

According to Apple, the "Continuity UX" to launch calls should be either one of the following.

1. Move the pointer over any phone number in Contacts, Calendar, Safari, or other app that automatically detects such data. Then click the arrow in the box that outlines the phone number, then choose Call [phone number] Using iPhone.
2. Or open the FaceTime app, enter a phone number in the search field, then click the audio call icon Audio.

[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209456](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209456)

According to Apple, our Mac needs to be properly configured in order to make continutiy work.You can use iPhone Cellular Calls with any Mac, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that meets the Continuity system requirements. It works when your devices are near each other and set up as follows:

- Each device is signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID.
- Each device is signed in to FaceTime with the same Apple ID.
- Each device has Wi-Fi turned on.
- Each device is connected to the same network using Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
- On your iPhone, go to Settings > Phone > Calls on Other Devices, then turn on Allow Calls on Other Devices.
- On your iPad or iPod touch, go to Settings > FaceTime, then turn on Calls from iPhone.

## FAQ

1. If your calls are not being opened in the phone but instead they are being launched on an another app like Skype, for example, you have to go open Facetime app on your mac, go to settings with `CMD + ,`, go to Settings tab, and in there, at the bottom, change the default app back to "Facetime.app".
