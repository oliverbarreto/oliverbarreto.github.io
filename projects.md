## Mac Development
1. **Calls on your mac:** easily create telcos and make calls with your iPhone the way you would want it to work. Also a favorite and and contacts manager.

# Vaulted

3. **Simon Says:** a very simple Simon Says implementation.
4. **TrasTras Game:** a very simple Pokemon game in which you catch pokemons on the screen with a poke-ball
