# Why This Site ???
**This is about writing without trying to write pro content.**

I am a father, a basketball coach, and another (not so common) guy that after getting a college engineering degree in IT was converted to the dark side of Management, Business Development and Product Marketing a long time ago. I spend time managing projects in the IT field, translating IT into product/market needs and viceversa. I also like to keep in touch with raw technology so i build things from time to time.
