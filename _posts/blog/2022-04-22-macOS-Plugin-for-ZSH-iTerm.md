First, you must use ZSH Plugins, and have 'macos' plugin installed.
In my case i have an alias to open zsh configuration called, guess what ?: 'zshconfig'

Then add:
```bash 
plugins=(
...
macos
...
)
```

Which enable your best new friends in town:

- `ofd`
to Open the current directory in a Finder window
- `pfd`
to Return the path of the frontmost Finder window
- `pfs`
to Return the current Finder selection


And finally, my favorite... 
- `cdf`
to `cd`Â to the current Finder directory
