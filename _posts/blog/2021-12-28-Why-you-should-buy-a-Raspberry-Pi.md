# Why you should buy a Raspberry Pi to make you love technology back again
Normal people don't want to mess around with technology. You just want to buy things that "just work". However, nowadays more or less everyone has some kind of piece of technology at home. Some have Sire, Alexa or Google smart speakers, assistants or even a security cam, or some smart lights or blinds. What would you say if having a few technical concepts in mind and armed with the intention to put technology at your service in several ordinary life areas. You only need two technologies to put up and running in just a few minutes cool projects: a Raspberry Pi and Docker.

## Raspberry Pi
Just like the [Arduino board](https://www.arduino.cc) is for those who like to play with electronics, the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) is for those who like playing with servers without spending a lot. Come on, its a fully fledged Linux machine that costs around 50€ sized no larger than the palm of your hand.

I been out of the DIY with technology scene at home, until i found the Raspberry Pi. It is a new, cheap and powerful toy that has gotten my attention and renewed my passion for using computers to bring ideas to life.

After buying my first Raspberry Pi, my Pi, I have now created a few things at home with the help of the second part of the equation: Docker.


## Docker
There was a time when in order to get a piece of software up and running at your service you had to almost be some sort of computer guru. Times have changed. After the democratization of technology in our palms with smart phones, by downloading apps for almost every usage that we can imagine, or using cloud and online services for almost every action in which we interact with any service company, we are now more prone to use more and more software.

At the same time advances in tech landscape have helped developers, and ultimately users, to use software in a more and more easier way than before. You don't have to be an expert in hardware, communications and a developer yourself. Software was once very hard to deploy, manage and run. Nowadays it is easier to just use the software by lowering the difficulty to get your apps up and running using the not so new kid in town called [Docker](https://www.docker.com). Forget about how to deploy it and where, its runtime issues, how to expose it on a network, or how to manage its usage of memory or storage, how to manage users security and permissions. These aspects can now be abstracted by the concept of a Docker Container, and in a way that it is consistent across different containerized applications. 

The best part is that now you can run Docker in a 50€ computer to play at home. You don't have to buy a server or use a PC to do this. Just buy a Raspberry Pi, [install its OS](https://dev.to/elalemanyo/how-to-install-docker-and-docker-compose-on-raspberry-pi-1mo), then [Docker](https://dev.to/elalemanyo/how-to-install-docker-and-docker-compose-on-raspberry-pi-1mo), then a simple management UI with [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io), and off to the races with your ideas for your home. 

Once you have them ready... it's just a matter of minutes aways of your next project at home. Yo can now bring to life things like putting in place an [Ad-Blocker](https://www.addictedtotech.net/how-to-install-pihole-docker-on-a-raspberry-pi/) for your kids, create a [DIY retro gaming console](https://www.circuitbasics.com/building-a-retro-gaming-console-with-raspberry-pi/), a [home media center](Docker (software)), or even more tech saavy projects like creating your on NAS or [VPN server](https://www.gmprazzoli.it/2020/03/30/set-up-a-home-vpn-with-a-raspberrypi-and-docker/), a [Home Assistant server](https://www.wundertech.net/how-to-setup-home-assistant-on-a-raspberry-pi-using-docker/), [password manager server](https://www.wundertech.net/how-to-self-host-bitwarden-on-a-raspberry-pi/), or even a substitue for Google Drive or Dropbox by creating [your own NextCloud](https://www.addictedtotech.net/installing-nextcloud-on-raspberry-pi-4/). 



What is going to be your first tech project at home ??? Belive me that the combination of these two is going to bring back your love for technology at your service.
