A note to my future self...

![image-right]({{ '/images/blogposts/2022-02-25-cat-computer.gif' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} Get used to work with moving lines instead of copying and pasting lines again and again and again...

Instead of thinking in terms of copying a line of text, moving to the place you want to place it, and then (finally) paste it there... think in terms of just: move the line directly to the place you want it to be.

**Move a line in VS Code & Obsidian**
0. Place the cursor on the line you want to move. Select multiple lines if you want by holding down `SHIFT` key.
1. Press `ALT + ARROW Keys` to move the selected lines up or down to the desired location
2. Tip: To make this work in Obsidian app, you have to configure your `HotKeys`in Preferences menu. Select `Move line up` and `Move line down` and assign a key shortcut, in my case I have `Option + ↑` and `Option + ↓`.

**Duplicate a line fast**
0. Just like the previous one, place the cursor on the line you want to duplicate.
1. Press `SHIFT + Option + ↑` or `SHIFT + Option + ↓` and voila, the line will be duplicated just below where your cursor is.
2. Tip: if you select various lines by holding down `SHIFT` while move your cursor to the lines you want you can duplicate those lines at once.

If you have a mac, you are in luck. If you just want to duplicate the line you are in, just:
1. Place the cursor on the line you want to duplicate.
2. And without selecting anything, press `CMD + C` and `CMD + V`, and voila, the line will be duplicated just below where your cursor is.
