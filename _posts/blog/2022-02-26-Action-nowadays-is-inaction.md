# Action nowadays is inaction
![image-center]({{ '/images/blogposts/20220226-empirestate-ukraine-flag.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center} Are your actions driven by the algorithm??? Trapped in a world of social media and YouTube??? ... where click-bait rules your time and your next action ???
<!--more-->

Imagine this... Ukrain is at war, they are at this very moment being invaded by another country: Rusia. What do you do? You fill the internet with Ukrainian flags on your social profile, even flagship buildings cover their glass structure with their flags colors... 

Does all that action lead to real action to solve the problem ??? It's simply millions of people doing nothing with their actions...

I am not saying that we all take a gun and go to fight.. it's just maybe that we should have done something a long time ago, and not in social media.

Here is a [post that offers a clear and good explantaion of "Movement" vs "Motion"](https://www.huntbigsales.com/blog/motion-vs-movement-in-the-new-era-of-selling/) and its relation to the principal concept of "Take Action"

“Motion” is a term that we use to describe all activities that occur in our daily life, which nowadays seems to be having conversations, exchanging information, and showing people on social media that we are doing something without actually doing it. 

But does it actually mean you are doing something ??? You care for it. Ok, great. Good to know. Now what ??? Are you gonna do something about it ???

Then we have, “Movement”, which is a term we use to denote completion, progress, job done, bring me the next. 

**If you want to meassure progress, meassure your movement: actions done in real world, not how many likes your facebook or instagram post have.**
