# My Decade-Long, Love-Hate Relationship with Note-Taking Apps

If you're anything like me, your digital life is a graveyard of abandoned note-taking apps. For over a decade, I've been on a relentless quest for the perfect digital notebook, a journey that has left me with a mixture of appreciation and intense frustration.

It started with the basics, like the simple Windows Notepad. Then came Evernote, which felt revolutionary at the time with its cloud sync and sharing. But it quickly became a behemoth of features I never touched, a digital filing cabinet so cluttered I could barely find the file.

I found a strange kind of love for the spartan, powerful interface of Sublime Text. It was the first app where I experienced the magic of multiple cursors. It let me forget about formatting and just write. But it was designed for code, not prose. The ability to have multiple tabs open was a constant invitation to distraction, pulling me away from the single, focused thought I was trying to capture.

Then came the Markdown-first editors. Typora was almost perfect—simple, clean, and Markdown-native. But then it became a paid app, and trying to export a PDF with any kind of custom styling was an absolute nightmare.

The app that truly pushed me to the edge was Day One. I loved its simplicity and the brilliant feature of associating notes with calendar days. It was beautiful. But it had a fatal flaw, a deal-breaker for me: my notes weren't my own. They were locked away in a proprietary database, not saved as simple, future-proof text or Markdown files on my computer. That was back in 2020, and it was the first time I seriously thought, "I should just build my own."

Even today's giants, Notion and Obsidian, feel like powerful suites designed for everything but focused writing. I admire Notion's interface, but it's a tool for building wikis and databases. The temptation to fiddle with page structure is a constant enemy of flow. Obsidian is a phenomenal tool for knowledge management, but sometimes I don't want to open my entire "second brain" just to capture a fleeting thought.

I knew exactly what I wanted. But there was a catch.

## From Product Manager to AI-Powered Builder

I’m not what you’d call a professional, full-time developer. My background is a hybrid: I have a technical foundation and I know how to code, but my career has been in Product Marketing and Management. I know how to listen to users, identify pain points, and design an application that solves a real problem. I had the blueprint for my perfect app, but the gap between blueprint and reality felt vast.

Then, everything changed. The recent explosion in AI Development Assistants created a new possibility. Suddenly, I had a partner. I could bring my product vision, my design sense, and my coding skills to the table, and the AI assistant could help me bridge the gaps, accelerate the development, and handle the heavy lifting.

This journey was no longer a distant dream. It was something I could start right now.

And so, with my own frustrations as the blueprint and an AI assistant as my co-pilot, I built Focus Note.

## Focus Note: The Solution to a Decade of Frustration

Focus Note is the app I’ve been searching for all these years. It's a minimalist, distraction-free, and powerful Markdown editor for macOS, built on a foundation of core principles learned from my long journey:

- You Own Your Data, Always: Learning from the Day One fiasco, Focus Note is local-first. All your notes are saved as plain Markdown files in a folder on your Mac. They are yours. Forever.

- A Sanctuary for Writing: Unlike the tab-happy environment of code editors or the endless options in Notion, Focus Note provides a clean, single-pane interface. It’s a space designed to help you enter a flow state and write without distraction.

- Powerful, Not Complicated: It has the features a writer needs, without the bloat. You can organize with simple tags, link notes together to create a web of ideas, and track your thoughts with a beautiful daily notes and calendar view.

- An Emphasis on Action: I've even included an optional "note dying" system. Notes you don't revisit are archived, gently nudging you to process your thoughts instead of just hoarding them.

## A Personal Cure, Shared Freely

From the beginning, my goal with Focus Note wasn't to build a commercial product. It was a personal mission, an obsession. I was trying to "cure" the collection of pain points I had gathered over a decade of using tools that were almost, but not quite, right. I simply wanted to build the app that I always wanted to use.

Because this project comes from a place of passion, not profit, I've decided to release Focus Note for free. It’s my solution to my problems, and I want to share it with anyone who might find it useful.

In solving my own frustrations, I suspect I may have built something that others will appreciate too. While I was my own first user, I realized that my personal cure might be a relief for others who share a similar mindset.

Perhaps you're a writer or student who, like me, craves a truly minimalist environment to think clearly. Maybe you're a Markdown enthusiast who values a beautiful and efficient editor, or a privacy-conscious user who firmly believes your data should belong to you and you alone. If you're an Obsidian user, you might find Focus Note to be the perfect, lightweight companion for capturing ideas without having to open up your entire vault.

If any part of my story resonates with you, I invite you to try it. Focus Note is the result of my journey, and I hope it can help you focus on what truly matters: your thoughts.

Built for the Focused, by the Frustrated

Focus Note is for you if any part of my story resonates. It's for the writers, students, and thinkers who crave a minimalist environment. It's for the Markdown enthusiast who wants a beautiful and efficient editor. It’s for the privacy-conscious user who believes their data should belong to them. And it’s especially for users of powerful tools like Obsidian who need a lightweight, fast, and elegant app to quickly capture notes without breaking their focus.

This is more than just an app for me. It’s the culmination of a decade-long search and a testament to how new technology can empower us to build the tools we've always dreamed of. This journey is just beginning, and I hope you’ll join me.
