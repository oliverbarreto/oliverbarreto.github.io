Here are some guidelines to get it up and running quick and strong:  
1.  Follow my todo list for installing apps for #productivity, #work, #design, #development, #communications, and #tools. Read my blog post [What's on my mac](http://www.oliverbarreto.com/blog/Whats-on-my-mac/):
- Productivity for Work
- Design
- Comunications
- Cloud sync
- Enthusiast Apps
- System level apps

2. Then install these [new apps](https://www.oliverbarreto.com/blog/Apps-You-Should-Have-On-Your-Mac-Updated/) that are needed for your notched-macbook to manage windows and the menu bar.

- [**Rectangle**](https://rectangleapp.com/): if you like [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) for window management in macOS to resize and rearange windows in a Windows10-ish style, you would like this one, pretty much the same app, but free. This app used to be Spectacle, but this version is now compiled for apple silicon). You can also take the pro route and install it via [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/index_es): `brew install --cask rectangle`

- [**Dozer**](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer): if you have an M1 "notched" MacbookPro, you will need to have the toolbar uncluttered. This app lets you hide them when you don't need them in a simple way. If you've heard of [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/), this is your app.

- [**The Unarchiver**](https://theunarchiver.com/): if you think that the zip tool that comes out of the box with the mac is limitted, so do many other people. For yo, this is an option to manage example rar files. This was a classic in my toolbox that I forgot, but recently, I remembered its value when I needed it, and didn't have it installed.
