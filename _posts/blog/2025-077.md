## Focus Note: The Solution to a Decade of Frustration

Focus Note is the app I’ve been searching for all these years. It's a minimalist, distraction-free, and powerful Markdown editor for macOS, built on a foundation of core principles learned from my long journey:

- You Own Your Data, Always: Learning from the Day One fiasco, Focus Note is local-first. All your notes are saved as plain Markdown files in a folder on your Mac. They are yours. Forever.

- A Sanctuary for Writing: Unlike the tab-happy environment of code editors or the endless options in Notion, Focus Note provides a clean, single-pane interface. It’s a space designed to help you enter a flow state and write without distraction.

- Powerful, Not Complicated: It has the features a writer needs, without the bloat. You can organize with simple tags, link notes together to create a web of ideas, and track your thoughts with a beautiful daily notes and calendar view.

- An Emphasis on Action: I've even included an optional "note dying" system. Notes you don't revisit are archived, gently nudging you to process your thoughts instead of just hoarding them.

## A Personal Cure, Shared Freely

From the beginning, my goal with Focus Note wasn't to build a commercial product. It was a personal mission, an obsession. I was trying to "cure" the collection of pain points I had gathered over a decade of using tools that were almost, but not quite, right. I simply wanted to build the app that I always wanted to use.

Because this project comes from a place of passion, not profit, I've decided to release Focus Note for free. It’s my solution to my problems, and I want to share it with anyone who might find it useful.

In solving my own frustrations, I suspect I may have built something that others will appreciate too. While I was my own first user, I realized that my personal cure might be a relief for others who share a similar mindset.

Perhaps you're a writer or student who, like me, craves a truly minimalist environment to think clearly. Maybe you're a Markdown enthusiast who values a beautiful and efficient editor, or a privacy-conscious user who firmly believes your data should belong to you and you alone. If you're an Obsidian user, you might find Focus Note to be the perfect, lightweight companion for capturing ideas without having to open up your entire vault.

If any part of my story resonates with you, I invite you to try it. Focus Note is the result of my journey, and I hope it can help you focus on what truly matters: your thoughts.

Built for the Focused, by the Frustrated

Focus Note is for you if any part of my story resonates. It's for the writers, students, and thinkers who crave a minimalist environment. It's for the Markdown enthusiast who wants a beautiful and efficient editor. It’s for the privacy-conscious user who believes their data should belong to them. And it’s especially for users of powerful tools like Obsidian who need a lightweight, fast, and elegant app to quickly capture notes without breaking their focus.

This is more than just an app for me. It’s the culmination of a decade-long search and a testament to how new technology can empower us to build the tools we've always dreamed of. This journey is just beginning, and I hope you’ll join me.
