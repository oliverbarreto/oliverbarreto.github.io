From time to time (last time was on 2010 [Some lessons to learn from...](http://oliverbarreto.blogspot.com/2010/08/some-lessons-to-learn-from.html)) it is good to remind myself these simple few lessons to learn from ... just like a reset message that I need to get through all the noise out there to hit my brain and force it to think about ... simple moves, simple math which can be applied in more complex problem solving... especially in personal matters !!!
