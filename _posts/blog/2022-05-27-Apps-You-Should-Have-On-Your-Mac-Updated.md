# (Updated) New apps that you should have on your mac
![image-right]({{ '/images/blogposts/20220528-m1apps.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} If your have a new M1 mac, these are a couple of new additions on my toolbox that I recommend for every Macbook Pro with a notch: [**Rectangle**](https://rectangleapp.com/), [**Dozer**](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer), and [**The Unarchiver**](https://theunarchiver.com/)
<!--more-->

- [**Rectangle**](https://rectangleapp.com/): if you like [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) for window management in macOS to resize and rearange windows in a Windows10-ish style, you would like this one, pretty much the same app, but free. 
- [**Dozer**](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer): if you have an M1 "notched" MacbookPro, you will need to have the toolbar uncluttered. This app lets you hide them when you don't need them in a simple way. If you've heard of [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/), this is your app.
- [**The Unarchiver**](https://theunarchiver.com/): if you think that the zip tool that comes out of the box with the mac is limitted, so do many other people. For yo, this is an option to manage example rar files. This was a classic in my toolbox that I forgot, but recently, I remembered its value when I needed it, and didn't have it installed.
