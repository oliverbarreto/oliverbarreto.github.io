# ![Focus Note logo](/images/focusnote_icon_v6_128x128.png "Minimalist note-taking for focused writing") Focus Note - Minimalist note-taking for focused writing.

**Built for the Focused, by the Frustrated.**

Welcome to Focus Note! A distraction-free, minimalist markdown editor designed specifically for macOS users who value simplicity and focus. Create, organize, and manage your notes with a beautiful, clean interface that gets out of your way.

## The Problem with Modern Note Apps

Most note-taking applications today are bloated with features you don't need:

- **Distracting interfaces** with too many buttons and options
- **Propietary data** you don't own your text
- **Cloud dependencies** that compromise your privacy
- **Complex organization systems** that slow down your workflow and break your focus

You deserve better. You deserve Focus Note.
